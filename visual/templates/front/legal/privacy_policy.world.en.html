        <p><strong>3. Server logs</strong></p>
        <p>In order to provide our online services securely and efficiently, we use the services of one or more web hosting
            providers from whose servers (or servers managed by them) the online services can be accessed. For these
            purposes, we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database
            services, security and technical maintenance services.
        </p>

        <p>When accessing our website, using Biganto VR player, Biganto mobile applications or Biganto applications for
            Oculus Quest VR headset (hereinafter collectively called Applications), personal data of the visitors is
            collected and processed by us. This may include, for
            example, the IP address of the system calling up the website and other communication data required to call up
            the website. Information provided by visitors in addition to this may also be part of the personal data
            collected and processed by us.</p>

        <p>The following data is stored in a log file, the so-called server log, when you visit our website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Information about the browser type and version used</li>
            <li>The user's operating system</li>

            <li>Date and time of access</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The <strong>legal basis</strong> for collecting this data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR (legitimate interest).
            It is not possible to object to this data collection, as the server log is indispensable to ensure the
            availability of this website and Applications and in case of attacks on the website.</p>

        <p>The data from the server log is automatically deleted after 14 days.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Support contact form</strong></p>
        <p>If you contact us by means of the contact form provided on the website, this is done on the basis of your consent
            (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR). We will use the data received via the contact form only to answer your request. A
            further use of this data by Biganto GmbH or third parties will not take place at any time.</p>


        <br>
        <p><strong>6. Online marketing</strong></p>
        <p>We also process personal data for online marketing purposes, which may include the marketing of advertising space
            and the presentation of advertising and other content (hereinafter "advertising content") based on the potential
            interests of users and the measurement of its effectiveness.</p>

        <p>For the above-mentioned purposes, so-called user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie")
            or similar procedures are used. Information in the user profiles may include, for example, the content viewed,
            websites visited, online networks used, but also communication partners and technical information such as the
            browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times.</p>

        <p>When storing IP addresses, we use the available IP masking procedure (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP
            address) to protect the user. As a general principle, raw user data is not stored for online marketing purposes.
        </p>

        <p>The profile data stored in e.g. cookies can later be read out and analysed for the purpose of content
            presentation, supplemented with further data and stored on the server of the online marketing procedure provider
            on other websites that use the same online marketing procedure.</p>

        <p>If Users are members of a Social Network whose online marketing procedure is used by Biganto, it is possible that
            the provider of the online marketing procedure (who may also be the provider of the Social Network) can assign
            raw data to the profiles. For this reason, we ask you to observe the data protection settings of the provider of
            the respective network. Biganto only receives access to summarized information about the success of our
            advertisements, such as statistical evaluations, for example. Within the scope of so-called conversion
            measurements, Biganto can check which of our online marketing activities have led to a so-called "conversion",
            i.e. whether, for example, a contract has been concluded with us due to an advertising activity. These
            measurements are only used to analyse the success of our marketing activities.</p>

        <p>The cookies will be stored for a period of two years unless otherwise specified.</p>

        <p><strong>Notes on legal bases</strong>: If we ask users for their consent for data processing by third party
            providers, the legal basis for processing data is consent. Otherwise, the users' data will be processed on the
            basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economic and recipient-friendly services).</p>

                    Google Tag Manager is a solution with which we can manage so-called website tags via an interface (and

                    offer). The Tag Manager itself (by which the tags are implemented) does not process any personal data of
                    the users. With regard to the processing of users' personal data, we refer to the following information

                    Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to
                    a Google server in the USA and shortened there.</p>
                <p>The IP address transmitted by the user's browser will not be merged with other Google data. Users can
                    prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting their browser settings accordingly; users can also prevent
                    Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to their use of the online service

                <p><strong>Google Ad Manager:</strong></p>
                <p>We use the "Google Marketing Platform" (and services such as "Google Ad Manager") to place ads on the
                    Google advertising network (e.g. in search results, in videos, on web pages, etc.). The Google Marketing
                    Platform is characterised by the fact that ads are displayed in real time based on the presumed
                    interests of users. This allows us to better target ads for and within our online offering to show users
                    only ads that potentially match their interests. For example, if a user is shown ads for products that
                    he or she has been interested in on other websites, this is called "remarketing". Service provider:

                    correspond to the potential interest of users and do not appear to be annoying. With the help of the
                    Facebook Pixel, we can also track the effectiveness of Facebook Ads for statistical and market research
                    purposes by seeing whether users are redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook Ad

        <p>On our website, you can log in to create a customer account or register using the plugin "Facebook Connect"
            of the social network Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Inc, 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA
            ("Facebook"), using the so-called single sign-on technique, provided you have a Facebook profile.</p>

        <p>If you call up a page of our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct
            connection to the servers of Facebook. The content of the plugin is transmitted from Facebook directly to
            your browser and integrated into the page. Through this integration, Facebook receives the information that
            your browser has called up the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a corresponding
            profile or are not currently logged in to Facebook. This information (including your IP address) is
            transmitted by your browser directly to a Facebook server in the USA and stored there. These data
            processing operations are carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR on the basis of the legitimate interest of Facebook in the display of personalized advertising based on browsing behavior.
        </p>

        <p>By using this plugin on our website, you also have the possibility to log in or register on our website
            using your Facebook user data. We will receive general and publicly accessible information stored in your
            profile when using this logon, depending on your personal data protection settings on Facebook. We will
            receive this information only if you give your express consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a)
            GDPR before the registration process on the basis of a corresponding note on the exchange of data with
            Facebook. This information includes the user ID, name, profile picture, age and gender.
        </p>

        <p>We would like to point out that after changes to the privacy policy and terms of use of Facebook, when you
            give your consent, there may also be a transfer of your profile pictures, your friends' user IDs and your
            friend list, if these have been marked as "public" in your privacy settings. This data is stored and
            processed by us to create a user account with the necessary data, if you have given your consent to do so
            on Facebook (title, first name, last name, address data, country, email address, date of birth).
            Conversely, data (e.g. information on your browsing behavior) can be transferred by us to your Facebook
            profile based on your consent.
        </p>

        <p>The consent granted can be revoked at any time by sending a message to the person responsible named at the
            beginning of this document.
        </p>

        <p>Facebook Inc. with headquarters in the USA is certified for the us-European data protection agreement
            "Privacy Shield", which guarantees compliance with the data protection level applicable in the EU.
